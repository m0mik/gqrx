Gqrx
====

Gqrx is an experimental software defined radio receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit. Currently it works on Linux and Mac and it can use the Funcube Dongle, RTL2832U-based DVB-T dongles, OsmoSDR devices and USRP devices as input source.

The following sections are some rather generic instructions for building the latest v2.1-git series.


Dependencies
------------

- The latest GNU Radio 3.6 (gnuradio-core and gnuradio-audio)
- The gr-iqbalance library (optional)
- At least one of:
    - gnuradio-fcd
    - gnuradio-uhd
    - RTL-SDR from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/rtl-sdr/
    - Osmo SDR from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/osmo-sdr/
- gnuradio-osmosdr from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/gr-osmosdr/
- pulseaudio (Linux only and optional)
- Qt 4.6 or later and optionally Qt Creator


Installation
------------

Get the latest code from: https://github.com/csete/gqrx
If you are compiling on Mac open gqrx.pro in Qt Creator and comment out the "AUDIO_BACKEND = pulse" line. You can now build gqrx from within Qt Creator (click build) or in a terminal:
$ qmake gqrx.pro
$ make

To build in debug mode add "CONFIG+=debug" to the qmake step above.

Various snapshot releases (source and binaries) are avaialble from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gqrx/

Third party app bundle for Macs can be downloaded here:
http://dekar.wc3edit.net/2012/09/30/osx-port-of-the-awesome-gqrx-sdr-software/

The binary packages are bundles containing the necessary GNU Radio, UHD, rtlsdr and Boost libraries.

Usage
-----

If you have been running pre-2.1, please delete $HOME/.config/gqrx/*
Gqrx will now open a device configuration dialog when you start and it will automatically detect all supported input devices that are plugged in.

If you don't see your device it could be that you forgot to add the udev rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/
You can test your device first with rtl_test, qthid, or uhd_usrp_probe that come with the respective packages.

Gqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices or if you want to use the same device under different configurations. You can load a configuratio from the GUI or using the -c command line argument. See "gqrx --help" for a complete list of command line arguments.


Known problems
--------------

- Reconfiguring a device may lead to application freeze or crash.
- Device arguments not well documented.
- Funcube Dongle may not work well on systems with libusb-1.0.9 (try gqrx-2.0 instead).
- Some settings are not saved between sessions.
